# ScrollTrotter

How many miles do you think we've all scrolled today?

This extension tries to answer this question precisely. It converts pixels scrolled into an actual physical unit of distance. It logs your scrolling adventures on the web and displays the metrics in a very big font but in a non-shaming way. Along with the list of your top scroll destinations on the web.

Note about the privacy of the extension: your scroll miles cannot be accessed by the author of this extension and can never leave your system.

Note about the accuracy of the calculation: The actual scroll distance may vary from the calculated distance. Different websites have different implementations for scroll events which makes the exact calculation of the distance very hard and beyond the scope of this extension.
